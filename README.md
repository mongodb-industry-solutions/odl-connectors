# MongoDB Operational Data Layer Connectors

This repository contains a growing collection of connectors designed to implement and operate a MongoDB-powered operational data layer (ODL).

Our goal is to support developers who want to explore and learn best practices for transforming and transporting data, enabling seamless participation within the ODL and its operations.

Some connectors focus on ingesting data into the ODL (input side), while others facilitate integration by connecting MongoDB data to target applications (output side).

This repository complements the MongoDB whitepaper [The Operational Data Layer](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/solutions/use-cases/implementing-an-operational-data-layer) which explains the core ideas and concepts behind building an ODL using the **MongoDB Data Platform**.
