# MongoDB Operational Data Layer Connectors

This repository contains a growing collection of connectors designed to implement and operate a MongoDB-powered **Operational Data Layer (ODL)**.

Our goal is to support developers who want to explore and learn best practices for transforming and transporting data, enabling seamless participation within the ODL and its operations.

Some connectors focus on ingesting data into the ODL (input side), while others facilitate integration by connecting MongoDB data to target applications (output side).

This repository complements the MongoDB whitepaper [The Operational Data Layer](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/solutions/use-cases/implementing-an-operational-data-layer) which explains the idea and concepts behind building such a layer with the **MongoDB Data Platform**.
