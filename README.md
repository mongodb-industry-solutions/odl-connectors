# MongoDB Operational Data Layer Connectors

This repository contains a growing collection of example scripts and code snippets designed to help implementing and operating a MongoDB-powered operational data layer (ODL).

Our goal is to help developers discover and master best practices for transforming and transporting unstructured and semi-structured data so it can participate seamlessly in the ODL. Practical guidance includes one core skill: turning anything into JSON.

Some connectors focus on ingesting data into the ODL (input side), while others facilitate integration by connecting MongoDB data to target applications (output side).

This repository complements the MongoDB whitepaper [The Operational Data Layer](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/solutions/use-cases/implementing-an-operational-data-layer) which explains the core ideas and concepts behind building an ODL using the MongoDB Data Platform.
